#[Affable.js]

## Introduction- 

Affable.js is a JavaScript library that helps you in determining the livability score of a neighborhood. Affable.js Livability Score is designed to help you find the best places to live. You can find the score of a neighborhood using this api. 
It is created using a unique ranking algorithm that considers characteristics like -<br /><br />
1)	No of Hospitals around you. <br />
2)	No of School/Universities around you.<br />
3)	No of Restaurant around you.<br />4)	No of Airports around you.<br />
5)	Crime rate in the area.<br />

All these characteristics are giving a score from 100 based on the ranking algorithm. Livability score for the location is determined by the below equation â€“ <br />

Final Score = HS * HF + SS * SF + RS * RF + AS * AF + CS * CF;<br />

Where, 
HS = Hospital Score, HF = Hospital Factor, SS = Schooling Score, SF = Schooling Factor, RS = Restaurant Score, RF = Restaurant Factor, AS = Airport Score, AF = Airport Factor, CS = Crime Score, CF = Crime Factor.<br/>

Each Factor is configurable and can be provided by the user as input.

*	Provides easy access to library function for retrieving details of places like Restaurant, Hospitals, Airports, Schools, Crime Rate along with the rating for each of them.
